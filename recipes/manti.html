    <p>They are a beloved dish in Uzbek cuisine, enjoyed for their rich taste and satisfying texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 lb (450 g) ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water (for filling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Dough: In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add warm water, mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make Filling: In a separate bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground black pepper, and salt. Mix well. Add 1/4 cup water to make the filling juicy.</li>
        <li>Divide Dough: Divide the rested dough into small, equal-sized balls (about the size of a golf ball).</li>
        <li>Roll Out Dough: On a lightly floured surface, roll each dough ball into a thin circle (about 4-5 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Add Filling: Place a spoonful of the meat filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Seal Manti: Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape, pressing the edges together to seal. You can also pinch and pleat the edges for a decorative touch.</li>
        <li>Steam Manti: Place the manti in a steamer basket, ensuring they do not touch each other. Steam over boiling water for about 30-40 minutes, until the dough is cooked and the filling is tender.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve hot, optionally garnished with chopped fresh herbs or a dollop of yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
